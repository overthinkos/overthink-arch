# charly_calver — the CalVer (YYYY.DDD.HHMM, UTC) that identifies a charly build.
#
# Single source of truth for the build-time version stamp, shared (R3) by:
#   - pkg/arch/PKGBUILD   — pkgver() (pacman package version) + build() ldflags
#   - taskfiles/Build.yml — `task build:charly` ldflags injection
#
# Injected into the binary via `-ldflags "-X main.BuildCalVer=$(charly_calver)"` so
# `charly version` reports a FROZEN, DETERMINISTIC build identity. The CalVer is
# derived ONLY from the HEAD commit's UTC date — so EVERY binary built from the
# same commit reports the IDENTICAL version: a dirty working-tree `task
# build:charly`, the clean `git+file://` makepkg clone its `pkgver()` reads, and an
# AUR build all agree. The build clock is never consulted: the wall clock
# identifies the MOMENT of a build, not its SOURCE, and that conflation is what
# makes two builds of one commit disagree (e.g. `pacman` pkgver vs `charly version`)
# and lets a stale binary falsely sort "newer" than a fresh one. The format
# matches ComputeCalVerAt() in charly/version.go exactly — CANONICAL fixed-width:
# YYYY = 4-digit year, DDD = 3-digit zero-padded day-of-year, HHMM = 4-digit
# zero-padded hour*100 + minute, all UTC. Fixed-width so a plain alphanumeric
# sort of CalVer strings is chronological.
